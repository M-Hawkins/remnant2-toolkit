### I hear this game is a soulslike, is it hard?

- The game does have its difficulties and it really depends on what you mean when it comes to "soulslike". Remnant differs drastically from Dark Souls and other souls-likes because of how the game fundamentally is at it's core; its RPG elements, how the game scales enemies/bosses, the only penalty for death being time wasted, its world layout, its inclusion of procedural generation, and the game's focus on ranged combat instead of melee combat (although melee is still viable). It’s similar to Dark Souls and other souls-likes in its emphasis on i-framing in combat, its reloading of enemies at save points, and the way it conveys the worlds’ lore to the player.

### Do I need to play Remnant 1 before Remnant 2?

- No, you do not. Although it is recommended to get more a feel for the story, learn some lore about returning characters, and just have an overall grasp of how the game plays. You could also try out Chronos Before the Ashes, a game which comes before Remnant 1.

### Is there cross-play?

- Yes! All you have to do to enjoy cross-play is link the platform you're playing on through Epic Games. This can be done through the main menu (when selecting a character) and utilizing the prompt at the top left of the screen. Any platform can play with any other platform, you just have to use Epic's system.
- Do not confuse cross-play with cross-save. Transferring your progress between platforms is cross-save, which is not something the game utilizes.

### What's up with the DLC stuff?

- The DLCs for Remnant 2 include The Awakened King, The Forgotten Kingdom and The Dark Horizon. Each can be bought separately or bought together with the DLC Bundle which does save you some money.
- The Awakened King DLC focuses on adding a third storyline to the world of Losomn.
- The Forgotten Kingdom DLC focuses on adding a third storyline to the world of Yaesha.
- The Dark Horizon DLC focuses on adding a third storyline to the world of N'Erud.
- The DLCs can be played in any order and do not have to be completed after any sort of other progress in the campaign. Enjoy them whenever you like.
- You also don't have to own the DLC to play the DLC. If someone you play with owns the DLCs, you are able to join them and enjoy that content. Although do note that not owning the DLC does not allow you to use the DLC items that come with it.

### Is there any sort of way for me to report a bug?

- Yes! Although before you report a bug, please try and see if your problem has already been identified and handled by looking at the https://discord.com/channels/439222927876030464/1139419671909642250 channel first. If you find something that you feel isn't working as intended or is causing issues for you, feel free to use the https://discord.com/channels/439222927876030464/1139042187422728192 channel and make a bug report.

### This may sound weird, but can I cheat and modify the game?

- If that is something you would like to do, sure. Please understand that all of that stuff is under a "use at your own risk" deal. Changing files for yourself or others can break some things in the game causing a loss of data which could be entire characters. So be sure to play safe and make save backups in case something does happen to go wrong. We also do not recommend going randomly into other people's lobbies/games and messing with their stuff without their permission. Some people want to experience the game for what it is, and don't want any sort of issues that can be tracked back to cheats or mods.

### Any good way to get information for this game?

- The Discord you're currently in is great for this! There is also the [Fextra wiki](https://remnant2.wiki.fextralife.com/Remnant+2+Wiki), the [community ran wiki](https://remnant.wiki), and a [builds/item tracking/tooling website](https://www.remnant2toolkit.com).

### How do difficulty rewards work?

- To get difficulty rewards, you need to kill each major boss in the game. Any Losomn World Boss, any N'Erud World Boss, any Yaesha World Boss, the Labyrinth Sentinel (Cube), and Annihilation. Killing all 5 of these will make you eligible for the difficulty rewards tied the difficulty you beat them on. Cube and Annihilation can only be done in campaign, whereas the world bosses can be done in campaign or adventure.
- You are able to earn these in co-op as well, being either the host or a client does not affect you earning the rewards. Do note that any sort of connectivity issue during a needed boss kill, may not give the kill credit for that boss and it will have the be attempted again. Do note that you cannot just join another player's world and purchase difficulty rewards.
- More information about difficulty rewards and what you can get can be found [here](https://remnant.wiki/Difficulty).

### How do account rewards work?

- Some rewards you earn through in-game challenges are labeled as account rewards, which means they are able to be purchased through their specified vendors even on brand new characters. It's recommended to check Brabus, Cass, Reggie, Mudtooth, and Wallace each time you make a new character to see what is available for purchase so you know what you don't have to chase down again.

[Back to Top](#toc)

### What exactly is a "One-Shot"?

- A "One-Shot" is what is available the **first time** your character chooses to experience the Awakened King/Forgotten Kingdom/Dark Horizon DLCs via adventure mode. It is a curated experience that forces all the new content that came along with that particular DLC. This includes the world boss, regular bosses, dungeons, and injectables.
- It is **HIGHLY** recommended to choose the difficulty carefully. It is also **HIGHLY** recommended to fully explore your "One-Shot" before rerolling. Once you reroll your "One-Shot", there is no way to get it back and get that curated experience again, unless you make a new character or find someone else who still has theirs available.

[Back to Top](#toc)

### What are injectables?

- Whereas each dungeon has a main event for it to be completed, injectables are mini events that can appear in most dungeons. Think of them like a possibly hidden side objective to take care of to get more loot. Skipping them has no negative effect on you at all, as they are entirely optional and do not have any requirement to progress in the game, they are strictly just to give you more loot.
- Just like with a majority of the other things in this game; injectables are also affected by the procedural generation this game utilizes and can sometimes not appear while you're rerolling. So if you're looking for a certain one and it hasn't appeared, you just have to keep trying until it manages to pop up.

### What does "Power level" and "World level" mean?

- Your character's power level (which can be seen in your character screen) is calculated based on your highest upgraded long gun and hand gun, along with your two highest level archetypes (even if they aren't equipped). This power level is what helps the game figure out how strong enemies should be, and what kind of materials it should drop so you can continue upgrading your gear.
- The world level (which can be seen in the corner of the minimap) is the game's idea of how strong enemies should be to keep the game a challenge for you as you progress and get stronger. Most times the world level is your character's power level +1, with the max being 21 (a power level of 20 +1). Although there are some progress points in the game that have minimum world levels, to give you a bit of a sense to explore some more so you can increase your power level.
- Ultimately it's recommended to be within 1 of the world level that is shown. This keeps the overall challenge, while also not being abysmally hard.

### What's a good difficulty to start on?

- The community seems to lean towards Veteran as a good starting point. It's still easy but also boasts a challenge for those that still want that experience.
- If you're looking for a "story" experience, the closest thing you'll find for that is Survivor. Which is also a good recommendation for people that haven't really experienced another game in the franchise.

[Back to Top](#toc)

### I feel like I'm lost, I have no idea where to go.

- The game has a system in the UI that helps with this sort of issue. When you're looking at your map while touching one of the big World Stones, you should see a ( ! ) icon. This is the area you need to be exploring to find the next location you need to go. While exploring an area with a ( ! ) icon, be sure to take a look at the doorways (in the minimap). If the doorway has a squared off top, it's a progression dungeon and IS required to move forward with the storyline you're currently doing. If the doorway has a rounded top, it's a side dungeon and IS NOT required for progression of the game.

### Is there still support for this game?

- As of writing this FAQ, yes. There are patches being delivered for balancing, bug fixes, and performance issues. The Dark Horizon DLC was labeled as "the final DLC", so there is not any expectations for another DLC to be launched for Remnant.

[Back to Top](#toc)

### What does rerolling do exactly?

- Using the large world stone in Ward 13 allows you to reroll your campaign and/or adventure. It's an expected and core gameplay feature that allows you to play, explore, and experience content you may not have gotten in your first initial playthrough of the campaign. Doing so can give you new world bosses, mini bosses, dungeons, and injectables for you to run through and get rewards that you didn't have a chance to get last time because of the procedural generation of the game.
- Rerolling does not affect anything with your character itself. You will keep your cool new stuff that you found on your character, unless it's a quest item. Quest items are lost because they are tied to specific events in the worlds you found them in. If you're rerolling your campaign/adventure, you're essentially losing that event you got it from, so there isn't a reason for you to keep the quest item alongside it.

[Back to Top](#toc)

### Should I reroll my campaign or my adventure? Which is better to do?

- If you're looking for certain rewards, you might be required to reroll your campaign. A few items that are in the game require a specific campaign set up to even acquire.
- Rerolling your campaign is also most times needed if you're planning on getting the difficulty rewards, as Labyrinth and Root Earth can only be done again via the campaign reroll feature.
- If you aren't looking to do either of the things above, or just don't want to go through a whole campaign again, adventure mode is perfectly fine to do. It let's you target 1 of the 3 main worlds to get just that experience and chance at it's loot.

### Who is Duane?

- Duane is Ward 13's beloved cook! He's a unique NPC with some "fetch-quest" style questlines that require a few items from different worlds, and for a reward for completing them he gives you some cool stuff.
- More information on Duane can be found [here](https://remnant.wiki/Duane).

## Labyrinth/Root Earth FAQ

### Why can't I roll these worlds in adventure mode?

- The Labyrinth and Root Earth are locations that have a strictly set layout that is not randomly rolled to any extent. Everything found in those locations is found in the exact same spot you found them last time; bosses, enemies, and items alike. So because there isn't any procedual generation for these two worlds, they are not included in adventure mode.

[Back to Top](#toc)

### Am I able to fight Labyrinth Sentinel (Cube), Cancer, Venom or Annihilation again?

- You cannot fight Labyrinth Sentinel again unless you reroll your campaign and get back to the Labyrinth.
- You cannot fight Cancer or Venom again unless you reroll your campaign and get back to Root Earth.
- You can fight Annihilation again in a couple ways; either by doing the Trial By Fire or Gauntlet version of Boss Rush and getting to the end, or by rerolling your campaign and getting back to the very end of the game.

### What is a Manticore?

- Manticores are the big rat-like enemies that appear while exploring Losomn, and there are a few special ones.
- The special ones only spawn in the base storylines of Losomn.
- If you are exploring parts of Dran Losomn (the non castle areas), you will find large sewer grates with bent bars in certain parts of the map. Walking up to these has a chance to have a Manticore reach out and grab at you. Depending on the area you are getting grabbed, changes the hidden reward for this encounter. If you are in the Dran Losomn overworld locations (not dungeons) and you get grabbed, you will find an Albino Manticore that upon death will give you the engram to make the Alchemist archetype. If you are in a sewer dungeon and you get grabbed, you will find a regular Manticore that is guarding an armor set and a ring.
- Failing to get grabbed, or dying during the encounter afterwards, does not mean you are locked out of the Manticore event. Simply try to get grabbed again.

## Archetype FAQ

### What archetype should I start with?

- This is a bit of a tough question to answer because the archetypes do have skills and passives that do boast certain gameplay styles. Some are better for teamplay, others are all around good to use, others give you the impression to play a certain way.
- With the uniqueness of archetypes in mind, there are a couple that are good for starters. Handler and Challenger both have a "self-res" mechanic when certain conditions are met, so those are usually the two that people go for when creating a new character or playing for the first time.

[Back to Top](#toc)

### I chose an archetype when I made my character, am I stuck with it?

- Not at all! Archetypes can be swapped around once you've gotten another one. You can even equip two of them. Feel free to change your archetype loadout as you see fit.

[Back to Top](#toc)

### I have this item that should give me an archetype, but I can't use the archetype?

- When you find an archetype item, it comes to you as an "engram". Engrams can then be brought to Wallace (the guy in the crane at Ward 13) and he can turn them into the actual archetype itself.

[Back to Top](#toc)

### Do I have to get an archetype all over again once I make a new character?

- If the archetype has already been earned once already, you are actually able to start as them when you make a new character. On top of that, you can just go to Wallace without finding the engram and just buy the archetype from him.

[Back to Top](#toc)

### How many are there? How do I get them?

- There are 14 archetypes to acquire and use. All of which can be obtained on a single character.
- Handler, Challenger, Hunter, and Medic can be bought from various vendors in Ward 13. Gunslinger is also available via Ward 13 but requires quite a bit of campaign completion to get access to it.
- Alchemist, Engineer, and Summoner are available through exploration of Losomn, N'Erud, and Yaesha respectively. They're either hidden in the map, require persistence through RNG and time, or maybe need a little greed to find.
- Archon and Invader are available through the Labyrinth and Root Earth respectively. Although they do require some progression through certain storylines to get. These two archetypes are also hidden.
- Explorer is available after beating the game for the first time.
- Ritualist, Invoker, and Warden archetypes are available through the Awakened King, Forgotten Kingdom, and Dark Horizon DLCs respectively. DLC ownership is required to utilize them.
